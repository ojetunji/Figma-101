### Figma 101

Hiya there 👋🏽 First of all, thanks for being here and making a move in your career
It’s exciting for me to have you here. My name is Dami Ojetunji, I'm a senior product designer doing some really cool work on early-stage startup teams from a cafe in Lagos while exploring the world.



In the past few years I’ve been developing
creative work on the fields of Design,
Digital art and illustration.


In the last year, I found myself in the world
of product and UI/UX Design.


Since then, just like you, I decided to learn
one of the greatest tools in the market
today: Figma
 In this beginner’s course, you will learn the basics and fundamentals of Figma and start your UI/UX journey
