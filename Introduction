### Figma 101

Hiya there 👋🏽 First of all, thanks for being here and making a move in your career
It’s exciting for me to have you here. My name is Dami Ojetunji, I'm a senior product designer doing some really cool work on early-stage startup teams from a cafe in Lagos while exploring the world.


When I found myself taking interest in the world of product and UI/UX Design, there wasn;t a lot of information and I,just like you, I decided to learn one of the popular tools in the market, Figma with little of no guide for a beginner like me. I made a lot of mistakes and it slowed down my first year of ux design navigating the tool and understandingits functions.

 In this beginner’s course, Let's save you the stress. you will learn the basics and fundamentals of Figma and start your UI/UX journey
